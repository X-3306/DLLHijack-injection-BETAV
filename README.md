# DLLHijack-injection-BETAV
The "DLLHijack Injection" tool enables the injection of malicious DLLs into target processes, allowing for DLL hijacking attacks. This technique can be used to exploit vulnerable applications by replacing legitimate DLLs with malicious ones, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or system compromise.

# Functions:
- Executes the code that will be injected into another process
- Performs DLL injection into a target process
- Performs DLL hijacking by replacing a target DLL with a malicious DLL
- Retrieves the process ID based on its name

# code explanation:
this code is an example of implementing two techniques: DLL Injection and DLL Hijacking in Windows. Here is a brief explanation of the code and its functionality:

ExecuteCode() function:
This function represents code that will be injected into another process. This is currently code that pops up a dialog saying "Code injected into another process!".

DLLInject() function:
This function performs DLL injection into the selected process. The function parameters are the ID of the target process and the path to the DLL to be injected. The procedure is as follows:

Opening a handle to the target process.
Memory allocation in the target process for the path to the DLL.
Saving the path to the DLL in the memory of the target process.
Create a remote thread in the target process that will load the DLL.
Waiting for thread to end.
Resource release.
DLLHijack() function:
This function performs a DLL capture for the selected file. The parameters of the function are the path to the target file and the path to the malicious DLL to replace the original one. The procedure is as follows:

Replace the name of the target DLL in the application path with the name of the malicious DLL.
Saving the modified path in the system registry.
GetProcessIdByName() function:
This function retrieves the process ID based on its name. Searches for processes with a name that matches the passed processName argument and returns the process ID.

main() function:
In the main function, there is an example of using both techniques.

First, the target process ID for DLL injection is retrieved by calling GetProcessIdByName() with the process name "target.exe".
Then the paths to the DLL (dllPath) and the target file (targetFilePath) are given, which will be used in the DLLInject() and DLLHijack() functions respectively.
The calls to DLLInject() and DLLHijack() perform DLL injection into the process and DLL hooking for the file.

Remember that currently the code is only an example of implementation, to use this code for testing and research purposes, you need specialized knowledge of programming in C ++
